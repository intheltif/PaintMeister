## Description
An application that allows a user to draw paintings on thier Android device.
Paintings can be saved and loaded to the Android's internal storage.
The user can modify the stroke color and the stroke width.

## How To Run
Can be ran either from Android Studio by selecting run.
Or can be ran from a device by installing the APK for the project (which has been moved
to the root directory for convenience)

## Design Decisions
We made a decision to stick to a minimalistic, light theme for this application.  This was
done to emulate an artist's canvas.  This also prevents eye strain when converting to one color
scheme to the PaintScreen that has the white background for painting.

## Known Issues

    *There are currently no known issues.
